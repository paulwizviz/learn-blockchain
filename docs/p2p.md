## Overview

A peer-to-peer networking architecture is a decentralized model where individual nodes (computers or devices) in the network act as both clients and servers, sharing resources directly with each other without the need for a central server. In P2P networks, each node can initiate or respond to requests, and they collaborate to perform tasks such as file sharing, distributed computing, or communication.

The key characteristics of a P2P architecture are:

* **Decentralization:** There is no central authority or server controlling the network. Instead, each node has equal status and contributes to the network's functionality.

* **Autonomy:** Nodes can join or leave the network at any time without affecting its overall operation. This autonomy enables scalability and resilience to failures.

* **Distributed Data Storage:** Data is distributed across multiple nodes in the network, enhancing redundancy and reliability. This distributed storage eliminates the risk of a single point of failure.

* **Self-Organization:** P2P networks typically employ protocols and algorithms for self-organization, allowing nodes to discover and connect with each other dynamically.
